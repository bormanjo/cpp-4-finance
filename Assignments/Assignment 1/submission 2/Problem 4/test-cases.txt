Test Cases:

The intent of my code in main.cpp is to demo the Money class with minimal user input. The code creates a third
Money object of the same currency as the first whose value is always 9.99 of that currency. This object is used to
demonstrate adding and subtracting of like currencies. The code then multiplies and divides by preset (int and double)
scalars 2 and 2.5 to demonstrate multiplication and division of multiple types. Finally, we attempt to add and subtract
both monies that the user entered

    Money 1             Money 2

1.  q q                 q q                 ->  Money 1: "q 0"
                                                Money 2: " 0"    - Nonsensical inputs default to currency: " " and value: 0
2.  USD 100.045         EUR 42.549          ->  Money 1: "USD 100.05"
                                                Money 2: "EUR 42.54" - Different currencies lead to addition/subtraction errors
3. $ 100.999999         $ 100.111111        ->  Money 1: "$ 101"
                                                Money 2: "$ 100.11"  - Same currencies lead to addition/subtraction values
