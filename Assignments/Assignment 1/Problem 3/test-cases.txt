Test Cases:

Since this problem is not based on user input, we must validate the sample moments with the analytical forms of the
distribution's moments. Thus the results in "output/dist-moments.csv" table should be within a reasonable range of
the moments calculated below.

1. Fair Coin:
 - Bernoulli Distribution
 Parameters:
 - p = 1/2

 Moments:
 - Expected Value:  1/2     = p
 - Variance:        1/4     = p * (1 - p)

2. 6-Sided Die:
 - Discrete Uniform Distribution
 Parameters:
 - a = 1
 - b = 6

 Moments:
 - Expected Value:  3.5     = (a + b) / 2 = (1 + 6) / 2 = 7 /2
 - Variance:        2.92    = [(b - a + 1)^2 - 1] / 12 = 35 / 12

3. Biased Coin:
 - Bernoulli Distribution
 Parameters:
 - p = 0.75

 Moments:
 - Expected Value:  0.75    = p
 - Variance         0.1875  = p * (1 - p)

4. Extreme Value (Type 1):
 - Gumbel Distribution
 Parameters:
 - a = 1
 - b = 1

 - gamma = 0.57721 # Note that this is the Euler Mascheroini Constant

 Moments:
 - Expected Value:  1.57721 = a + (b * gamma)
 - Variance:        1.64493 = (pi^2 / 6) * b^2

5. Normal Distribution
 Parameters:
 - mu = 0
 - sigma = 1

 Moments:
 - Expected Value:  0 = mu
 - Variance:        1 = sigma

6. Student-t Distribution
 Parameters:
  - t = 10

 Moments:
 - Expected Value:  0
 - Variance:        1.25 = t / (t - 2) for t > 2
